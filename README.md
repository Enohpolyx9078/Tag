# Tag

[My Notes](notes.md)

Tag. It's tag. It'll be a real time online multiplayer version of the classic playground game. There's a lot of potential features to be added here, such as powerups, maps, custom skins, and all the like. Down the road, we'll see just which features get added, but the core gameplay loop will be the eternal game of tag.

> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown: I looked up markdown syntax and made sure to follow proper conventions
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Did you play tag on the playground? Why does such a basic game have so much appeal? Whatever the reason, tag was fun as a kid, and it can still be fun even when your friends are farther away than they used to be. Imagine the chaos of a real time online multiplayer game of tag enhanced by powerups, custom art, and more. A simple game to pull friends together to chat, laugh, and maybe cause a little mamyhem along the way. Are you ready to play?

### Design

![Login Screen](res/img/login.png)

This is the login/create account screen. This will be the default page when the server is first hit.

![Profile Screen](res/img/profile.png)

After logging in, the user will be sent here. This screen shows gameplay statistics and customization options. Here is also where the user can create and join games.

![Game Screen](res/img/game.png)

This is the main gameplay screen. In the middle is the actual game. On the left is a screen showing the other players in the room, and on the right shows the user and their stats for the round.

    Server -->>Player2: Player1 left
    Server -->>Player3: Player1 left
    Server -->>Player1: Player1 tagged Player3
    Server -->>Player2: Player1 tagged Player3
    Server -->>Player3: Player1 tagged Player3

```

The server will act as the brain of the game. It will keep track of player locations and when someone is tagged.

### Key features

- Real time online multiplayer
- Individual player statistics are recorded
- Player skins are customizable
- Rooms can be created and joined by players so friends can play together
- Obstacles and powerups make rounds diverse
